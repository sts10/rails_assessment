Rails Assesment

The answers to this assesment should be submitted in the form of a link to a github repo
The repository should be a rails app with one additional file in the root directory called assesment.txt

Create a blog.

The blog should have the ability to have posts and comments on posts.  There's no need to add a user model.

From any post I should be able to both see all the comments and add a comment myself.

Questions to be answered in the assesment.txt file.

How does rails communicate with the database?  Please be thorough in discussing all the config files and pieces of rails necessary to communicate with the database.

Rails' database.yml file establishes the connection to the database, using SQLite3 in our case. Migrations are written and stored in db/migrate. 


What is a resource?
A resource is a collection of a model, migration, controller, and views that represent a "thing" that your program has. "Post" or "comment" are good examples of these. If there's some thing in your app that users will expect to be able to create, read, update and destroy (CRUD!), it's probably a resource.

What are the standard RESTful routes for a resource?

Method   URI       Description

GET      /posts    Shows all posts (index)
GET      /post/:id Show user an individual post
GET      /new      Presents or shows user with new post form
POST     /posts    Post route to create new posts. 
GET      /posts/:id/edit  Presents user with the form to edit posts
PATCH    /posts/:id  Update route to edit posts
